### Rendering a black hole using Raymarching

For this project, I used Unity's HSLS Compute Shaders to render a black hole. The script simulates a photon traveling and circulating around the black hole. I found the rough code for the simulation in this [Shadertoy Script](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wdt3zM). The shading is done procedurally, for the background I used an HDRI.
